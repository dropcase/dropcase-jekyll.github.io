Still not sold on this, unless I can figure out a better way to manage the content. It's tough when I'm on at least three different systems between home and work. Yes, it's all maintainable through [GitHub][gh], but I need to be able to use [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] from Windows on all three.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I like using git for managing the content, and I like that I finally have a place to push [dropcase.com][dc] to for free (relatively speaking). Maybe I need to look into getting comfortable with [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] and ruby and the rest will follow.

Riding the learning curve has always been worth it.
