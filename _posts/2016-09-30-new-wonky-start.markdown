Starting again is no fun, especially when your host disappears off the face of the earth. Ok, they're almost still around - there's just no actual people responding to anything. It's a ghost ship.

I'm trying something different. This time it's [Jekyll][jekyll-home] and ruby on [GitHub][gh], and maybe I can get it all working. Version control, check. Robust platform, check. Support, check. I don't need or want a full-on CMS, I just want somewhere to be able to write and post a few things.

[gh]:   https://github.com/
[jekyll-home]: https://jekyllrb.com/
