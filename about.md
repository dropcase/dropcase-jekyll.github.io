# Introductions #

I hate these things and I never know what to say. I'm not going to try and be clever or tell you that I've got it all under control - it's more like "holy eff I think I have a handle on this for the next few (days | minutes | seconds)".

I started dropcase.com in May of 2003, thinking that I wanted to learn how to do some Web development and maybe start another site or two once I was up and running. That didn't happen - although I learned a lot about managing the backend of a site and PHP and MySQL and other stuff along with my day job.

Now I do Application Support and manage a team supporting and working with  groups in the US, Sweden, Belgium, and Japan.
